        "answer": "Yes. In *Suchitra Srivastava v. Chandigarh Administration*, the Supreme Court recognised that the right to reproductive choice i.e. the right to choose whether to carry her pregnancy to full term is part of the woman’s right to health, personal liberty and privacy guaranteed under Article 21 of the Constitution. Similarly, in *K S Puttuswamy v. Union of India* and *X v. Principal Secretary, Health and Family Welfare Department, Govt. of NCT of Delhi & Anr* [‘X v. Principal Secretary’; the Supreme Court has reiterated that it is part of the right to decisional and bodily autonomy of the woman to decide whether she wants to continue her pregnancy to ‘full term’ or not. The Court also held that all women (including pregnant persons other than cis-gender women) have the right to access safe, legal abortion. The Supreme Court has in multiple decisions held that the right to abortion is a concomitant right of dignity, autonomy and reproductive choice It is therefore imperative that the fundamental right of a pregnant person is not compromised for reasons other than to protect the physical and mental health of the pregnant person."

Access to abortion should be available to persons irrespective of their marital status. Furthermore, “change in marital status” [Rule 3B (iii)] has been interpreted to include any such change in relationship status of a married or unmarried woman which would be a change in the material circumstances in her life. The Supreme Court had allowed an unmarried woman to terminate her pregnancy on the ground that her partner refusing to marry her would constitute a “change in material circumstances” in her life and such a circumstance is covered under Rule 3B."

        "answer": "The Court has interpreted Rule 3B as only an “illustrative” list of circumstances which constitute a* change in material circumstances in life of a pregnant person*. Rule 3B cannot be given a narrow and strict interpretation to only include the circumstances mentioned in the list because doing so would exclude several persons, including unmarried women, who may have equally valid reasons to terminate their pregnancy. Therefore, the Court held that any circumstance which resembles the social, financial, mental or physical position of a woman mentioned in the circumstances given in Rule 3B would become a valid ground for termination. This effectively means that any change in material circumstances in life of a pregnant person would be a valid ground for termination. These are such circumstances which would affect a pregnant person’s decision to continue the pregnancy even at such an advanced gestational age.\nThis would include circumstances such as a woman suffering from domestic violence, a woman abandoned by family or partner, a woman who has lost her job and is no longer financially secure, a wife living separately from husband and seeking divorce, etc.\nTherefore, when any RMP is expected to give an opinion regarding termination of pregnancy when the gestational age has exceeded 20 weeks, they should take into consideration this broad interpretation given to Rule 3B by the Supreme Court and assess the circumstances of the pregnant person accordingly."

The scope of “grave injury to mental health” is broad and must be interpreted to include all circumstances that may affect the pregnant person’s mental health. While examining whether continuation of pregnancy would cause injury to the health of the pregnant person, it is necessary to take note of the person's actual or reasonably foreseeable environment [Section 3(3)]. Furthermore, opinion of the pregnant person must be given primacy in evaluating the foreseeable environment of the person. The Courts have interpreted that anguish caused by any unwanted pregnancy would cause a grave injury to the pregnant person’s mental health.

        "answer": "The purpose of the opinion of the RMP is to protect the health of a pregnant person and facilitate safe, hygienic, and legal abortion. While giving their opinion, the RMP(s) should recognize that in such cases it is the pregnant person’s decision and choice related to their pregnancy and body that needs to be respected, while making their assessment regardingeconomic, and cultural factors￼ operatingenvironment￼. Therefore, RMPs assessment should not be limited to strictly medical and clinical factors.\nAdditionally, the service provider should ascertain that MTP is not being sought following prenatal sex determination. The service provider must ensure that the termination is not being sought due to the discovery of the gender of the foetus."

        "answer": "No. The doctors’ assessment should only be limited to the conditions mentioned in the MTP Act, which only focus on the effect of the pregnancy on the life of the pregnant person. The opinions must be addressed to an assessment of a likely risk to the life of the woman, or of grave injury to her physical or mental health; or a likelihood of the child being born with serious physical or mental abnormalities. It has been recognised that forcing a person to carry an unwanted person by denying them the option to terminate the pregnancy would be a violation of their fundamental right and dignity.

They must refrain from imposing any extra-legal conditions on the pregnant person such as seeking consent from husband or other family members, demanding proof of marriage, information regarding use of contraceptive devices, etc. It is only the pregnant person’s consent (guardian’s in case of a minor or mentally ill person) that is material."

The Medical Board should examine the pregnant person and their reports and after due consideration allow or deny termination of pregnancy. Within three days of the receipt of request for abortion, the Medical Board should provide its opinion on termination of pregnancy in Form D. [MTP Rules 3A]\nMedical Board’s opinion should record reasons and must reflect the effect of the pregnancy on the pregnant person's physical and mental health.

When should the termination be done?**\nMedical Boards should ensure that termination procedure must be carried out within 5 days from the receipt of the request for abortion.

        "question": "Can a pregnant person seek abortion for any reason other than those mentioned in the MTP Act when pregnancy has exceeded 24 weeks?",
        "answer": "A pregnant person can approach the High Courts and the Supreme Court under their extraordinary jurisdiction (under Articles 226 and 32, respectively) in certain circumstances to terminate their pregnancy beyond the statutory limit of 24 weeks. The Courts have held that since the right to seek abortion is a fundamental right, the Courts have the power to enforce this right even at such an advanced stage of pregnancy when the continuation of such pregnancy would cause severe injury to mental or physical health of the pregnant person and termination would not be harmful for the health of the pregnant person. In such a case, the Courts apply their mind to the facts, examine the effects of continuation of pregnancy on the pregnant person and rely on the opinion of the Medical Board regarding the health of the pregnant person and the foetus in case termination is to be done.\nCourts (Supreme Court and various High Courts) have allowed termination at this stage in following circumstances:\nMinor girl/Minor survivor of Rape;\nSurvivors of Rape;\nMother suffering from depression;\nThe continuation of pregnancy in the socio-economic condition of the pregnant person would have an impact on their mental health;\nPregnant person showing suicidal tendencies and continuation of pregnancy can impair their mental stability.\nIn some decisions prior to the 2021 amendment (when the statutory limit for abortion was 20 weeks and not 24 weeks), the Bombay High Court have allowed termination of pregnancy beyond the statutory limit in circumstances where the Petitioner was a survivor of domestic violence and where the Petitioner was not ready to become an unwed mother.\nIn all these cases the Courts emphasised that continuation of pregnancy under such circumstances would cause grave injury to mental health of the pregnant person and would be a violation of their fundamental right to reproductive choice, privacy and health under Article 21. The Courts should ensure that they don’t cause unnecessary delay in adjudicating matters of abortion at this stage since delay may cause mental and physical anguish to the pregnant person and may also increase complications in termination. Such delay would be a negation of the fundamental rights of the pregnant person. Abortion matters must be adjudicated immediately and without delay."

To avoid delay and complications due to legal formalities, the rules that would otherwise apply are relaxed.\nIf one RMP is of the opinion that the termination of a pregnancy is immediately necessary to save the life of the pregnant person, such pregnancy can be terminated anywhere. However, the termination must be carried out by a RMP only after recording such an opinion. Such an RMP is also not required to have any minimum years of training in gynaecology and obstetrics as is otherwise prescribed in MTP Rules 2003. The pregnancy in such circumstances can be terminated even at a place that has not been approved under Section 4.

However, “life” under Section 5 does not have the same broad interpretation as “life” under Article 21 of the Constitution. It would include circumstances that would pose danger to the life of the pregnant person including risks due to foetal anomalies or impairments.

The doctors aware of the incidence of rape are expected to report the same to the police authorities, however, it is not required that the matter be reported before the termination of pregnancy or as a condition for the termination procedure.

This would mean that in every case of a minor approaching a doctor for termination of pregnancy, they would be obligated under POCSO to report the matter. In cases where the age of the person is not known and it is doubted that the person is a minor, the matter should still be reported so that investigative agencies can determine the age. However, the provision of mandatory reporting does not mean that a minor can be denied abortion until and unless the matter is reported. No permission from Court or police authorities is required to carry out the abortion procedure. The reporting requirement should not become a cause for delay of the abortion procedure since access to abortion is a fundamental right. As per the CAC 2018 guidelines, medical practitioners have no obligation to file complaints or investigate, but only to inform authorities when providing abortion services to minors. The provision of services should not be affected by the legal proceedings.\nException to the provision of mandatory reporting for abortion:\nOn the request of the minor and the guardian of the minor, the RMP need not disclose the identity and other personal details of the minor while providing information under Section 19(1) of the POCSO Act. The court also held that the RMP who has provided information under Section 19(1) of the POCSO Act is also exempt from disclosing the minor’s identity in any criminal proceedings which may follow from the reporting of the matter. This is to ensure that the mandatory reporting provision does not become a barrier for minors to access safe and legal abortion."

It does not regulate termination of pregnancies which is the scope of the MTP Act. If a doctor’s intention, while performing any procedure, is not to increase the probability that an embryo will be of a particular sex or determine the sex of the embryo/foetus, then the procedure will not amount to sex-selection and will not be regulated by the PCPNDT Act. Therefore, abortion procedureis not prohibited or regulated by the PCPNDT Act.\nAuthorities under the PCPNDT Act do not have broad powers to regulate abortion and cannot harass doctors without reason or evidence. In *Dr. S**ai w/o Santosh Shiradhkar v. State of** Maharashtra*, the Bombay High Court had observed in a case involving complaint under the PCPNDT Act that criminal prosecution against doctors must be initiated after careful enquiry and presence of criminal intent and not based on minor procedural lapses.\nHowever, an abortion service provider should ensure that an abortion is not being done after sex-determination diagnostics or that sex-selective abortion is being carried out.

        "question": "If a pregnant person seeking abortion approaches a Primary Health Centre (‘PHC’) or a frontline health worker (such as Anganwadi, ASHA worker), how should they be assisted?",
        "answer": "When a pregnant person seeking abortion approaches a PHC or frontline/community health worker, they should be accompanied to the nearest public health facility and aided in accessing safe abortion services. As per the CAC guidelines, at PHCs pregnant person must be counselled on the legality of abortions and provided information on the availability of abortion services. They are also supposed to supply contraceptive methods (condoms, oral pills) to the person seeking abortion. The care and information should be provided confidentially. A PHC can even provide medical examination and post-abortion counselling and care services to the pregnant person.\nIn some of the states, to increase safe abortion, incentives have also been introduced. For example, in the states of Assam, Bihar, Punjab, Odisha Rs 150 are provided to ASHA workers to accompany the pregnant person who wants to abort their pregnancy to the abortion facility. Under the National Health Mission, ASHA workers are given an incentive of Rs. 150/- for accompanying women for Post-abortion IUCD insertion."

        "question": "What financial assistance programs are available to help the pregnant person cover the cost of abortion?",
        "answer": "Abortion services (counselling, abortion procedure and post-procedure care) are covered under the centre-run Ayushman Bharat scheme. Therefore, eligible beneficiaries under the scheme would be provided financial assistance in covering the costs of abortion services.\nSome states like Bihar have introduced ‘Yukti Yojana’ to subsidise abortion at private clinics in the state, to make abortion services more accessible."

        "question": "Can a person be forced to use contraceptive methods/devices post the abortion procedure?",
        "answer": "No. Neither the MTP Act nor any government guidelines provide for any mandatory prescription or use of contraceptives by the pregnant person.\nThe Comprehensive Abortion Care guidelines encourage use of contraceptives by men and women to avoid unwanted pregnancies, but this cannot be imposed on women and cannot be a condition for them to access safe abortion services."

        "question": "What are the guidelines for counselling pregnant persons seeking abortion?",
        "answer": "As per the *P**rovider's Manual for Comprehensive Abortion Care, 2020*, it is the doctor’s responsibility to counsel the pregnant person before their procedure. This would include clearing any doubts related to the termination of pregnancy, its consequences, informing them about their legal rights under the MTP Act. The pregnant person must be informed of the various methods of abortion, including the option of medical and surgical abortion procedures. The pregnant person should be informed that they have the option to choose between the different permissible abortion methods and give their informed consent.\nThe doctors must identify the reason for the termination of pregnancy by asking only relevant questions related to their personal, social, family and medical history and the past use of contraceptive methods. The pregnant person must be informed whether the procedure would affect their future fertility. The pregnant person should be informed about the risk of pregnancy in case a contraceptive is not used after the procedure and helped in choosing a contraceptive method post-procedure.  Even if the pregnant person is not willing to accept a contraceptive method, they must not be denied abortion."

        "question": "What are “post-procedure” care requirements to be provided by the service provider?",
        "answer": "Abortion care services extend to post-procedure care as well. Doctors must inform the patient about self-care instructions, being vigilant of any unusual bleeding or symptoms that could be dangerous. If further reproductive health assistance is necessary, the service provider should refer to the individual, clearly explaining the reasons for referral, identifying the appropriate facility, and detailing the procedures to be conducted. Service providers should inform about the immediate risk of pregnancy if no contraceptive method is used and should help the pregnant person in getting the appropriate service. However, use of post-procedure contraceptives is not mandatory, and abortion is not to be denied if the woman is unwilling to use contraceptive methods."

        "question": "What if there is delay on the part of the service providers in carrying out the abortion?",
        "answer": "The Courts have recognised that various hurdles such as insufficient infrastructural facilities or hesitation and lapse on the part of RMP(s) and Medical Board(s) in giving their opinion causes delay in accessing abortion services or a complete denial of such services. Such denial would be a negation of the fundamental rights of the pregnant person. Time sensitivity is of vital importance in abortion cases, especially considering the associated health risks and that the fact that if gestational age crosses statutory limit, it will become difficult for the pregnant person to seek abortion. The CAC guidelines also provide that abortion service delivery must be woman-centric and the needs of the woman must be prioritised and that a￼.  Therefore, service providers (especially state authorities), should not cause unnecessary delays in carrying out abortion.\nHowever, no action can be taken against any service provider if such delay is being caused other than reporting the matter to the CMHO of the district or other senior authorities."

        "question": "If the RMP does not recommend termination of pregnancy and the pregnant person wants an abortion, what can they do?",
        "answer": "The pregnant person can challenge the opinion of the RMP/RMP(s) in the Court. The pregnant person can seek an order from the Court directing the doctors to terminate their pregnancy. The pregnant person can do so since the right to reproductive choice is a fundamental right and individuals can approach the High Court or the Supreme Court for the enforcement of their right. Furthermore, if conditions under the MTP Act are being met, then a public hospital should not deny someone abortion services.\nIt is important to note that under the law, the RMP would face no consequence for denying abortion services and neither can the pregnant person challenge or appeal against the RMP’s opinion before any forum or authorities."

        "question": "Can a pregnant person be denied abortion services when conditions under the MTP Act are met?",
        "answer": "No. Apart from few circumstances explicitly provided in the MTP Act, a pregnant person cannot be denied abortion. The right to health, including the right to reproductive health, is also a facet of the right to life under Article 21 of the Indian Constitution. The Courts have held that if a pregnant person does not want to continue with the pregnancy, then forcing them to do so represents a violation of the pregnant person’s fundamental rights. Furthermore, as per the CAC guidelines, service providers must ensure that abortion remains accessible and available to women near their homes.\nSome authorities have also directed that government hospitals with trained staff under their jurisdiction cannot refuse abortion services to a pregnant woman seeking abortion."
